# Open-Meteo TypeScript SDK

A dedicated client library for Open-Meteo is available here https://github.com/open-meteo/typescript. This client adds convince functions to use `fetch` to retrieve data.

Is uses the Open-Meteo SDK FlatBuffer from this repository. If you do not want to use `fetch`, but decode FlatBuffers messages yourself, you can install only the compiled schema files with  `npm install @openmeteo/sdk`.
